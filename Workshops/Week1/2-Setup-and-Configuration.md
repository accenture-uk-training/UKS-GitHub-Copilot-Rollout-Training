### Known Limitations for ABAP Development with GitHub Copilot

Before relying on GitHub Copilot for ABAP development, be aware of these important limitations:

#### 1. Eclipse/ADT integration limitations (validate in your environment)

ABAP Development Tools (ADT) uses Eclipse-specific mechanisms for accessing ABAP objects. Some Copilot features that operate by editing local files (for example, multi-file edits or agentic workflows) may behave differently depending on your Eclipse/ADT setup.

- If you see unexpected behavior with ABAP objects, fall back to **Ask mode** and apply changes manually.
- Use the [Copilot feature matrix (Eclipse)](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-feature-matrix?tool=eclipse) as the source of truth for what is supported.

#### 2. ABAP Language Support Quality

GitHub Copilot's AI models are trained primarily on publicly available code repositories. Since ABAP is a **proprietary SAP language** with limited open-source code available:

- Suggestions may be **less accurate** compared to popular languages (Python, JavaScript, Java)
- Complex SAP-specific patterns, BAPIs, and function modules may not be well-represented in training data
- Code completions for standard ABAP constructs work, but domain-specific SAP modules may have inconsistent support
- Custom SAP tables, data elements, and domains are unknown to Copilot

#### 3. Eclipse Installation Dependencies

Users have reported dependency conflicts during GitHub Copilot installation in Eclipse:

- Conflicts with **Mylyn WikiText UI** and **LSP4e** components may occur
- "Cannot satisfy dependency" errors may prevent installation
- **Solution:** Ensure your Eclipse installation is fully up-to-date and consider removing conflicting plugins if necessary

#### 4. Network and Certificate Issues

Organisations using corporate proxies may experience:

- Certificate validation failures during sign-in
- Language server connection issues
- **Solution:** Configure the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable to point to your organisation's CA certificates

#### 5. SAP Backend Connectivity

ABAP development requires connection to an SAP backend system. GitHub Copilot:

- Cannot access your SAP system metadata directly
- Has no visibility into your custom function modules, classes, or data dictionary objects
- Cannot suggest code based on your specific SAP customisations or transport requests

#### Best Practices for ABAP Developers Using Copilot

1. **Use Copilot for boilerplate code:** Standard ABAP syntax, loops, SELECT statements, and common patterns
2. **Provide detailed comments:** Help Copilot understand your intent with descriptive ABAP comments (`" comment`)
3. **Verify all suggestions:** Always review generated ABAP code against SAP documentation and your system's data dictionary
4. **Combine with SAP tools:** Use Copilot alongside SAP's built-in code templates, patterns, and ABAP documentation
5. **Leverage for non-ABAP files:** Copilot works well for related files like JSON, XML, JavaScript (UI5/Fiori), and documentation

---

## Part 3: Configuration and Customisation

### Enable/Disable Copilot Globally or Per File

#### VS Code

1. **Enable/Disable Completions:** Click the arrow next to the Copilot icon in the title bar → **Configure Inline Suggestions** → Select **Enable Completions** or **Disable Completions**
2. **Via Settings:** Go to **File → Preferences → Settings**, navigate to **Extensions → Copilot**, then check/uncheck **Inline Suggest: Enable**
3. **Disable for specific languages:** In Settings, under "Enable or disable Copilot for specified languages," click **Edit in settings.json** and configure:
   ```json
   "github.copilot.enable": {
       "*": true,
       "yaml": false,
       "plaintext": false
   }
   ```
4. **Trigger inline suggestion:** Press `Alt+\` (Windows/Linux) or `Option+\` (Mac)

#### Visual Studio

1. **Click the GitHub Copilot icon** in the bottom panel (status bar) of the Visual Studio window
2. When disabling, you'll be prompted to choose:
   - **Disable Globally** - turns off Copilot for all files
   - **Disable for [Language]** - turns off Copilot only for the current file's language
3. The icon shows a diagonal line through it when disabled

### Set Your Preferred Model

If your subscription provides multiple model options:

**VS Code:**
1. Open **Copilot Chat** (for example: open the chat view from the Copilot icon, or use **Quick chat** `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L`)
2. Use the **model picker** in the chat input field (if available for your plan/policy)
3. Select from available models (varies by subscription — see [Supported AI models](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/supported-ai-models-in-copilot))

> **Note:** Different models have different premium request multipliers, which can affect your monthly usage allowance. Copilot Business users may need their organisation to enable model switching.

---

## Part 5: Troubleshooting

> **Tip:** If GitHub Copilot stops working, first check [GitHub's Status page](https://githubstatus.com/) for any active incidents.

### Copilot Extension Won't Install

**Solution:**
- Verify you're using the latest IDE version
- Check internet connection
- Try uninstalling and reinstalling the extension
- Update your GitHub Copilot extension. Older clients cannot communicate with Copilot servers
- Check IDE compatibility in the [IDE Support Guide](../../FAQ/IDE-support.md)

### No Suggestions Appearing

**Solution:**
- Verify Copilot is enabled (check status icon, a diagonal line means disabled)
- Check if the file is excluded by content exclusion settings (hover over the icon to see)
- Wait briefly. Copilot needs context and can sometimes take a while to load
- Ensure you're signed in to GitHub
- Update to the latest extension version

### Authentication Errors (VS Code)

**Solution:**
1. Click the **Accounts icon** in the bottom left corner of VS Code
2. Hover over your GitHub username and click **Sign out**
3. Press `F1` to open the command palette, then select **Developer: Reload Window**
4. After VS Code reloads, sign back in to your GitHub account

### Slow or No Responses

**Solution:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Reduce file size if editing very large files
- Try a different model if available
- Check [GitHub Status page](https://githubstatus.com/) for service issues
- Review firewall/proxy settings if in a corporate environment

---

## Part 6: Best Practices for Setup

1. **Start with VS Code** if you're new, it has the most complete Copilot integration
2. **Keep your IDE updated** to ensure compatibility with latest Copilot features
3. **Use keyboard shortcuts** to speed up workflow, refer back to this guide as needed
4. **Disable Copilot for sensitive files** if working with proprietary or security critical code
5. **Customise your shortcuts** to match your existing workflow
