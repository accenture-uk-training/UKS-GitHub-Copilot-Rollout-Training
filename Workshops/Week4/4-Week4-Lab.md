# Week 4 - Modernise Your Legacy Code with GitHub Copilot

Please follow the instructions below to complete the hands-on lab for Week 4.

_Leverage GitHub Copilot to refactor and modernise a school's legacy COBOL accounting system into modern Node.js._

## Welcome

- **Who is this for**: Developers looking to update and improve their legacy codebases
- **What you'll learn**: How to leverage GitHub Copilot to refactor and modernise existing code
- **What you'll build**: A set of improved code snippets that demonstrate modern coding practices, migrating a legacy COBOL accounting system to Node.js
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Skills exercise: [Getting Started with GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/skills/getting-started-with-github-copilot)
  - Familiarity with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Basic coding principles
- **How long**: This exercise takes less than 30 minutes to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Explain the current state of your legacy code.
1. Create a diagram of the data flow in your code.
1. Identify areas of your legacy code that can be improved.
1. Use GitHub Copilot to generate modern code snippets.
1. Replace the old code with the new snippets and test the changes.

### How to start this exercise

Simply copy the exercise to your account, then give your favourite Octocat (Mona) **about 20 seconds** to prepare the first lesson, then **refresh the page**.

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organisation to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
