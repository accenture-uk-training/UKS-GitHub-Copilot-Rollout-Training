# Facilitator Guide

A quick reference for trainers delivering the GitHub Copilot Training Program.

---

## Program Goals

1. **Build Copilot fluency** - Developers confidently use all interaction modes (Ask, Edit, Agent, Plan)
2. **Improve productivity** - Participants integrate Copilot into daily workflows
3. **Ensure quality** - Teams generate secure, standards-compliant code
4. **Foster responsibility** - Developers understand ethical implications of AI-assisted coding

---

## Weekly Objectives

| Week | Theme | Key Outcome |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Foundations | Participants set up Copilot and use basic features |
| **2** | Prompt Engineering | Participants write effective prompts and customise Copilot |
| **3** | DevOps & Testing | Participants generate pipelines, IaC, and tests |
| **4** | Quality & Ethics | Participants refactor safely and code responsibly |

---

## Session Format

Each week follows a consistent structure:

1. **Presentation** (30-45 min) - Concepts and demonstrations
2. **Hands-on Lab** (45-60 min) - Guided exercises with real code
3. **Reflection** - Participants submit feedback via issue templates

**Total commitment:** 8-11.5 hours across 4 weeks

---

## Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Participants have Copilot licences activated
- [ ] IDE setup instructions sent in advance
- [ ] Lab repository access confirmed
- [ ] Issue templates ready for reflections
- [ ] Demo environment tested

---

## Delivery Tips

- **Live coding** - Demonstrate prompts in real-time; show failures too
- **Encourage experimentation** - Let participants try different prompt styles
- **Address scepticism** - Acknowledge limitations; focus on practical value
- **Review submissions** - Check lab reflections to identify common struggles

## Common Questions

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "Will Copilot replace developers?" | No - it's a productivity tool that requires human judgement |
| "Is the code it generates secure?" | Not guaranteed - always review, especially for security-sensitive code |
| "Can I use it for client projects?" | Check your organisation's AI usage policy |
