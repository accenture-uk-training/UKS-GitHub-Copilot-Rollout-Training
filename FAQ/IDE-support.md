#### Copilot Chat
- **Fully available** in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Eclipse, and Xcode
- **Also available** on GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, and Windows Terminal
- Use chat to ask coding questions, get explanations, and receive help in natural language

#### Copilot Edits
Make changes across multiple files from a single prompt:
- **Edit Mode:** Granular control over edits - you choose which files to modify
- **Agent Mode:** Copilot autonomously determines what needs to be done
- **Available in:** VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains IDEs

#### Agent Mode
- **Autonomous editing:** Copilot determines which files to modify and iterates to complete tasks
- **Terminal commands:** Can suggest and run terminal commands to complete tasks
- **MCP integration:** Connects with external tools and services (VS Code only)
- **Full support:** VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs
- **Preview:** Eclipse

#### Next Edit Suggestions (Preview)
- Predicts where your next edit will be and suggests completions proactively
- **Available in:** VS Code, Xcode, Eclipse

#### Contextual Awareness
- **Deep integration** allows Copilot to understand context beyond just the current file, such as project structure and open files (VS Code and Visual Studio)
- **Quality of suggestions** may depend on the IDE's extension quality, but generally offers robust, file-based context
- **Copilot Spaces:** Organise and centralise relevant content to ground Copilot's responses in the right context

### Context Provision
- Open relevant files and set imports to provide Copilot with necessary context
- Organise your workspace to help Copilot understand your project structure

### Review and Validation
- **Always review, test, and verify Copilot's output before implementation**
- Test generated code thoroughly in your development environment
- Ensure the code follows your project's best practices and coding standards

### Documentation Automation
Use Copilot Chat to generate:
- Docstrings
- Inline comments
- README files

**Example prompt:** *"Generate a Python docstring for this function."*

### Adoption Strategies
- Encourage regular measurement of adoption metrics
- Provide tailored training for your team
- Foster community engagement and knowledge sharing
- Consider gamification or champion programs to boost participation
