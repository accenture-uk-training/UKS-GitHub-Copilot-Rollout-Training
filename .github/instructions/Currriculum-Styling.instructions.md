- Always use the same formatting for headings, lists, and links across all markdown files to maintain a consistent style.
- Use British English spelling (e.g., "familiarise" instead of "familiarize") throughout the curriculum.
- When listing prerequisites, use bullet points and ensure that each item is concise and clear.
- In Code blocks always comment on the purpose of the code and any important details that learners should be aware of.
- Do not use emdashes (—) in markdown files, instead use full stops (.) or commas (,) to separate clauses in sentences.
- Ensure all pages have a "Next Steps" section at the end that guides learners on what to do after completing the current page, such as linking to the next page in the curriculum or additional resources. Except for "FAQ" documents.
- When content is updated, ensure that the main README.md file on the repo root is also updated to reflect any changes in the curriculum structure or content.
- When the curriculum is updated, update the `**Last Updated:** DD/MM/YYYY` line near the top of README.md to reflect today's date in DD/MM/YYYY format.
- For issue templates, ensure that the template is clear and concise, with specific sections for the user to fill out (e.g., "Description of the issue", "Steps to reproduce", "Expected behavior", "Actual behavior", etc.).
- When content is updated also ensure that the issue templates are reviewed and updated if necessary to reflect any changes in the curriculum.
